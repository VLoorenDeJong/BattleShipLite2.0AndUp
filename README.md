# BattleShipLite1.0AndUp
This started as a homework assignment after that I wanted to strech my legs and see where I could take it.

## Things I added my self are:
* Opening screen
* View of placed ships
* AI Player
* Graphical representation of the field (Original: A1 A2 A3)
* Random commentary
* Winner screen
